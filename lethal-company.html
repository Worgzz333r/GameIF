                <p class="outer-p"><span class="bold">Lethal Company</span> is an
                    cooperative survival horror video game developed and published by Zeekerss. It was released in early
                    access in October 2023 and gained popularity on the Steam storefront.</p>

                <p class="inner-p">In Lethal Company, players obtain and sell scrap from abandoned, industrialized
                    exomoons while avoiding traps, environmental hazards, monsters, and the hostile fauna. As employees
                    of "The Company", players must sell enough scrap to meet a series of increasing profit quotas until
                    they inevitably fail and the game starts over.</p>

                <h2 class="lower-title">Gameplay</h2>

                <p class="inner-p">Lethal Company is a cooperative video game for up to four players played in
                    first-person perspective. Set in a retrofuturistic world, players explore abandoned moons to collect
                    valuable scrap. They must navigate procedurally generated facilities, avoid traps, and fight off
                    creatures, all while racing against time. Players can communicate and coordinate using proximity
                    chat and text chat. Success depends on teamwork, resource management, and timely returns to their
                    ship. Failure to meet the Company's quota results in a game over.</p>

                <p class="inner-p">The game offers 12 explorable moons, each with unique challenges and rewards. Players
                    must strategically choose which moons to visit, considering their difficulty and potential profits.
                    Moons can be affected by dangerous weather conditions like flod, quicksand, and solar eclipses,
                    further increasing the risk. The moons are inhabited by various hostile creatures. Players must
                    navigate these dangers
                    while efficiently collecting scrap and returning to their ship before the deadline.</p>

                <h2 class="lower-title">Development</h2>

                <p class="lower-p">Lethal Company has received critical acclaim on the online storefront Steam, topping
                    the platform's Global Top Seller list and having 100,000 concurrent players in November
                    2023. Its popularity has been attributed to social media and compared to the
                    similar horror game Phasmophobia.
                </p>

                <p class="sec-lower-p">Kelsey Raynor of VG247 noted that the game "...might not look like much given its
                    grisly cel-shaded graphics, but fans are wholly obsessed with Lethal Company, and its gruesome
                    aesthetic is clearly just another part of its charm." Gabriel Moss of IGN said that "Lethal
                    Company already instills a sense of wonder", and that the game's co-op loot hunts "manage to
                    transcend its limited content and missing systems." PCGamesN included Lethal Company on its
                    listing of best horror games available on PC.</p>
